# Raceline Optimization
[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

An optimal racing line minimizes the time needed to complete the course. 

We define a track by a set of waypoints (or gates) `(x,y)` and a track width `w`. To finish a lap a car must pass through each waypoint while not leaving the track boundary.
