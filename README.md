# Raceline Optimization

ðŸš§ _currently not stable for release_ ðŸš§

An optimal racing line minimizes the time needed to complete the course. 

We define a track by a set of waypoints (or gates) `(x,y)` and a track width `w`. To finish a lap a car must pass through each waypoint while not leaving the track boundary.
